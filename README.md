### Summary

- [X] Be contained in one single file, called `mypython.py`
- [X] When executed, create 3 files in the same directory as your script, each named differently (the name of the files is up to you), which remain there after your script finishes executing. Each of these 3 files must contain exactly 10 random characters from the lowercase alphabet, with no spaces ("hoehdgwkdq", for example). The final (eleventh) character of each file should be a newline character.
- [X] When executed, print out on screen the contents of the 3 files it is creating in exactly the format given below.
- [X] When executed, after the file contents of all three files have been printed, print out two random integers (whose range is from 1 to 42, inclusive), and print out the product of the two numbers, again in exactly the format given below.
